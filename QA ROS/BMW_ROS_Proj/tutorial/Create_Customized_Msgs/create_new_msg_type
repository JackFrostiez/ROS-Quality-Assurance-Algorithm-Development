How to Prepare CMakeLists.txt and package.xml for Custom Topic Message Compilation

In order to create a new message, you will need to do the following steps:

    1. Create a directory named 'msg' inside your package
    2. Inside this directory, create a file named Name_of_your_message.msg (more information down)
    3. Modify CMakeLists.txt file (more information down)
    4. Modify package.xml file (more information down)
    5. Compile
    6. Use in code


For example, we are going to create a message type called "Age"


Step 1:
	cd to your package
		$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/my_package
	create msg directory
		$ mkdir msg
	
Step 2:
	create a file named "Age.msg" in msg folder
	put data type and variable names in the folder, e.g.:
		float32 years
		float32 months
		float32 days
	
Step 3:
	Edit CMakeLists.txt file in the package folder.
	We need to edit 4 functions:
		find_package()
		add_message_files()
		generate_messages()
		catkin_package()
	
	For find_package(), put "message_generation" after the other packages:
	
### Code Start ###
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
	rospy
	std_msgs
	message_generation
)
### Code End ###
